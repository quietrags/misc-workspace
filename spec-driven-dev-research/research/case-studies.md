**Last Updated:** 2025-11-10
**Next Review:** 2025-12-10

---

## Purpose

Real-world implementations of spec-driven development. Updated as new case studies emerge.

---

## Enterprise Case Studies

### Case Study Template

For each case study, document:
- **Company Profile** (size, industry, tech stack)
- **Challenge** (specific pain point addressed)
- **Solution** (tool/approach selected)
- **Implementation** (timeline, team size, process)
- **Results** (quantitative metrics, qualitative outcomes)
- **Lessons Learned** (what worked, what didn't)
- **Source** (interview, blog post, conference talk, with date)

## Y Combinator Winter 2025 Cohort

### Overview
**Industry:** Startups (mixed)
**Scale:** 25% of W25 batch
**Finding:** 95% AI-generated codebases

### Context
- Y Combinator W25: Fastest-growing batch in YC history
- 10% per week growth rate
- Correlation (not causation) with AI code generation

### Approach
- Rapid prototyping with AI tools
- Heavy use of Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- Vibe coding for MVP development
- [Spec-driven adoption: to be researched]

### Results
**Positive:**
- Extreme velocity (10% weekly growth)
- Rapid iteration
- Lean founding teams

**Unknown/To Monitor:**
- Long-term code quality
- Technical debt at scale
- Transition to production-grade systems

### Lessons
- AI enables extreme speed for startups
- MVP development well-suited to current tools
- Production readiness requires different approach

### Solution
[AWS Kiro implementation details]

### Results
[Quantitative outcomes when available]

**Source:** AWS customer case studies (when published)

---

## GitHub Spec Kit Community

### Open Source Project Adoption

**Status:** Emerging (2025 launch)
**Projects:** [To be tracked]

### Early Patterns
- Individual developer adoption strong
- Team adoption emerging
- Integration with existing workflows

### Community Feedback
- [Monitor GitHub issues, discussions]
- [Track blog posts, conference talks]

**Source:** GitHub Spec Kit repository, community discussions

---

## Nagarro Client Implementations

### [Placeholder: Client Success Story]

**Industry:** [To be documented]
**Challenge:** [Specific pain point]
**Solution:** [Spec-driven approach + Fluidic Intelligence]
**Results:** [Quantitative metrics]

**To Develop:**
- Work with Nagarro teams to document client success stories
- Focus on measurable outcomes (DORA + SPACE metrics)
- Highlight Fluidic Intelligence integration
- Demonstrate "From Prototype to Production" value prop

---

## Industry-Specific Applications

### Healthcare

**Opportunity:** High regulatory compliance requirements align with spec-driven governance

**Challenges:**
- HIPAA compliance
- FDA regulations for medical devices/software
- Audit trail requirements

**Fit for Spec-Driven:**
- Excellent (specifications enable compliance verification)
- Audit trails from specs
- Regulatory documentation generation

**Case Studies Needed:** [To be researched]

---

### Financial Services

**Opportunity:** Security, compliance, maintainability priorities

**Challenges:**
- SOC2, PCI-DSS compliance
- Security vulnerability concerns
- Code review requirements

**Fit for Spec-Driven:**
- Excellent (governance framework aligns with financial services needs)
- Specifications as compliance documentation
- Quality gates integration

**Case Studies Needed:** [To be researched]

---

### SaaS / High-Growth Tech

**Opportunity:** Balance velocity with quality

**Current Evidence:**
- 90% AI-generated code in some companies
- Quality concerns (GitClear data)

**Challenges:**
- Speed pressure from market
- Technical debt accumulation
- Scaling engineering teams

**Fit for Spec-Driven:**
- Good for production systems
- Vibe coding may be better for early MVP
- Transition point: Series A/B when quality becomes critical

**Case Studies Available:**
- Y Combinator W25 data (vibe coding heavy)
- [Need examples of SaaS companies using spec-driven]

---

### E-Commerce

**Opportunity:** [To be researched]
**Challenges:** [To be researched]
**Fit for Spec-Driven:** [To be assessed]
**Case Studies Needed:** [To be researched]

---

## Antipatterns & Failures

### When Spec-Driven Doesn't Work

**Document failures/challenges:**
- Over-specification (Thoughtworks concern)
- Waterfall mindset
- Specification becomes bureaucracy
- Team resistance

**Case Studies Needed:**
- Teams that tried and abandoned spec-driven approach
- What went wrong?
- What would they do differently?

**Purpose:** Balanced view, learn from failures

---

## Comparison Studies

### Vibe Coding vs. Spec-Driven

**Research Opportunity:**
- Same team, same project, different approaches
- Controlled comparison
- Metrics: DORA + SPACE + code quality

**Hypothesis:**
- Vibe coding: Faster for MVP/prototype
- Spec-driven: Better for production systems
- Combination: Best for real-world projects

**Studies Needed:** [To be developed]

---

## Developer Experience Research

### Qualitative Findings

**To Document:**
- Developer satisfaction with spec-driven workflows
- Learning curve
- Context switching (spec writing vs. coding)
- Cognitive load

**Sources:**
- Developer surveys
- Team retrospectives
- Interview research

**Status:** [To be developed]

## Research Methodology Notes

### How to Evaluate Case Studies

**Quality Criteria:**
1. **Quantitative metrics:** DORA, SPACE, code quality
2. **Timeline:** Before/after comparison
3. **Team size:** Context for scalability
4. **Project complexity:** Simple vs. complex tasks
5. **Source credibility:** First-hand, verifiable

**Red Flags:**
- Only vendor-provided success stories
- No quantitative metrics
- Cherry-picked results
- Missing context (team, project, timeline)

### Balanced Reporting

**Include:**
- Successes AND failures
- Positive AND cautionary results
- Context and limitations
- Replication challenges
