## 🔍 Research Foundation

### Evidence Base Summary

**Positive Findings:**
- ✅ 55% speed improvements (GitHub Copilot)
- ✅ 20% productivity (Nagarro Fluidic Intelligence)
- ✅ 300% maintainability with structure
- ✅ 85% fewer vulnerabilities with governance

**Cautionary Findings (GitClear 211M lines analyzed):**
- ⚠️ 7% code churn (quality concern)
- ⚠️ Refactoring decline: 25% → <10%
- ⚠️ Code duplication up 48%
- ⚠️ Thoughtworks status: "Assess" (not "Adopt")

**Balanced Interpretation:**
Spec-driven development is valuable governance framework, not silver bullet. Structure helps quality at scale, but requires intentional implementation.
