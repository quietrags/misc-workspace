# Misc Workspace

A repository for miscellaneous tasks, experiments, and quick prototypes.

## Purpose

This workspace serves as a flexible environment for:
- Quick coding experiments
- One-off scripts and utilities
- Learning new technologies
- Testing ideas before moving to dedicated projects
- Temporary work that doesn't fit into other repositories

## Structure

Tasks and experiments will be organized in subdirectories as needed.

## Task Management

This project uses [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for task tracking.

- `bd ready` - Show unblocked tasks
- `bd list` - List all tasks
- `bd create "description" -p [0|1|2]` - Create new task

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory may contain its own README with specific instructions.
