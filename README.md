# Misc Workspace

A repository for miscellaneous tasks, experiments, and quick prototypes.

## Purpose

This workspace serves as a flexible environment for:
- Quick coding experiments
- One-off scripts and utilities
- Learning new technologies
- Testing ideas before moving to dedicated projects
- Temporary work that doesn't fit into other repositories

## Structure

Tasks and experiments will be organized in subdirectories as needed.

### Active Projects

1. **[spec-driven-dev-research/](./spec-driven-dev-research/)** - Research project on spec-driven development with AI coding agents
   - Point of view document for engineering leaders
   - Evidence-based analysis of AI coding tools
   - Monthly updates on evolving landscape

2. **[ai-coding-challenges/](./ai-coding-challenges/)** - AI-augmented coding challenge framework
   - Challenges designed to push AI coding tools to their limits
   - Choose 2 out of 3 challenges (Legacy Modernization, Distributed Systems, Security & Performance)
   - Comprehensive evaluation framework and research methodology

## Task Management

This project uses [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for task tracking.

- `bd ready` - Show unblocked tasks
- `bd list` - List all tasks
- `bd create "description" -p [0|1|2]` - Create new task
